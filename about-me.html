                    <p>
                        Hey! I'm Damian, an Argentinean professional with more than ten years of 
                        experience in different areas such as ERP Implementation, Business Management, 
                        Project Management and Sales Operations. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For the first ten years of my professional life I have been perfecting my skills in Consulting, 
                        Project Management, ERP Software Implementation, leading teams and delivering trainings to employees; 
                        but since 2021 I have discovered my true passion. Programming and development.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I have started a University career in the Universal Arts school in 2021, pursuing the career of 
                        Senior Programmer Specialized in Video Game Design. So far, I completed the masters of Game Design, 
                        Programming in Unreal Engine and Programming in Unity. This is my final year in what is called 
                        The Studio Production experience which tries to simulate a real life video game studio, with the 
                        objective of developing a full game throughout the year (estimated completion, June 2024).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My passion for video games made me discover this world and thanks to this I also started learning 
                        other programming languages such as HTML, CSS and JS (which are used in this portfolio). 
                        So in parallel to video game development I am on my path to becoming a full-stack engineer.

                        This is a bit about myself and you can check the other sections of my portfolio to see how I 
                        reinvented myself and became a full time developer.
